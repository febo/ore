# ORE JavaScript Client

A generated JavaScript library for the ORE program.

> [!NOTE]
> The generated client is compatible with [version 2 of Web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js/v/2.0.0-rc.1).

## Getting started

To generate the JavaScript client using [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) from the root of the repository, you may use the following command.

```sh
pnpm generate
```

This will generate the IDL from the API annotation and generate the JavaScript client.

To build the client, go into the client directory and use the following commands.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
